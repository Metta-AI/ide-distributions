"""Take secrets out of captured text before it is hashed or written.

The gateway writer calls Hermes's own scanner and adds patterns for Softmax User and Player tokens.
Those patterns stay here and are not registered with Hermes, because a registered pattern would also
change what the agent sees in its tool output. Tested on 2026-11-04: Hermes alone leaves a bare
``usr_...`` token untouched.

Only the gateway has this scanner and only the gateway sends free text. Every other writer has only
``mask_softmax_tokens``, for the metadata strings it sends. Digests and byte offsets in records
refer to the redacted text.

An image's base64 text is left alone. Hermes's JWT pattern matches ``eyJ`` wherever it occurs, so a
scan damaged each of three 1 MB test images (2026-11-04), and no pattern can read a secret out of
base64.

A token split by a control character passes the Softmax patterns. Hermes joins such splits only for
its own list of formats.

Hermes's scanner has known gaps, each seen on the real one (Hermes 0.22.6, 2026-11-05):
``docs/agent-telemetry.md``, "Known holes". Nothing here closes them.

Hermes keeps exact browser vault values per profile home and looks them up from the calling
thread's scope. The writer thread has no profile scope, so it does not apply them. Hermes already
removes those values from browser tool results before the model sees them.

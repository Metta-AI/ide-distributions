"""Where telemetry leaves a process: one ``write`` per line to the container's output stream.

The Datadog Agent collects whatever a container writes there. Every process opens the stream of PID
1 itself and never uses its own stdout, because ``run_in_workspace`` takes a tool process's last
stdout line as the tool's result (``plugin/executor.py``).

On Linux one ``write`` of at most 4,096 bytes reaches a pipe whole, so lines of different processes
never mix. Above that size concurrent lines tear, which is why ``records.MAX_LINE_BYTES`` is a hard
limit.

Other output shares this stream, and can have a line open when a telemetry line arrives: an
unbuffered ``print`` writes its text and its newline separately, a child can leave a line
unfinished, and a pipe splits a long line. So each telemetry line starts with a newline of its own
(``records.line_bytes``), at the price of a blank line on the stream. Buffering cannot do this: it
covers only Python's writers, and buffered stdout makes an interpreter abort at exit when a thread
is stuck on a full pipe.

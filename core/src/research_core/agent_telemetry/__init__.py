"""Capture agent operations as lines on the container's output stream, for Datadog.

``CONTRACT.md`` beside this file says what a line and a body hold, and how a request is rebuilt from
them. ``docs/agent-telemetry.md`` says what is captured and how to read it.

Every module here is stdlib only, because the gateway plugin imports them in Hermes's interpreter.

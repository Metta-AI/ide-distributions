"""The ``softmax_api`` tool (design C.2): any Observatory route, with auth handled.

The escape hatch for routes no tool covers (the ``softmax-api-routes`` skill lists them). The
path is relative to ``/observatory``; the call runs as the Player, or as the User when the
Orchestrator asks (the Researcher is Player only). Every call is logged as a
``platform.request`` event (method, path, identity, outcome, status) in the Coworld store, or the
workspace store for a Session with no Coworld, so frequent routes can become proper tools. A write
made as the User leaves a notice (workspace store) once its outcome is known: "Acted as your User
identity: <METHOD> <path>" (A4.7), or "may have acted" when the platform gave no clear answer. The
user learns of anything done in their name. Runs in the workspace environment.

"""The ``experiment`` tool (design B.8, C.2): a comparison of Versions that ends in a verdict.

Every action is available to both roles. The store module does the record work (validation,
the design lock at ``start``, the lease check when the Experiment has a Task); this module maps
arguments to it and adds the one computation a tool needs numeric libraries for: the computed
verdict at ``close``. That is why the tool runs in the workspace environment (A3.1) even though
most of its actions are store-only.

``close`` has two paths:

- **Explicit**: ``verdict`` is given with ``measurements`` and ``interpretation``; the reason
  codes are ``reason_codes`` or ``["explicit:<reason>"]``. This records a judgement (usually the
  Orchestrator's) when the decision rule cannot be applied as pre-registered.
- **Computed** (no ``verdict``): the Experiment's methods become an ``EvaluationDesign``
  (the candidate is ``methods.candidate`` or, when that stayed empty at start, the one Version
  built for the Experiment), the rows stored on its runs are paired baseline against candidate
  by seed, and ``decision_rule.evaluate`` gives the verdict, the reason codes and one
  measurement per metric. ``interpretation`` is optional here; a one-line summary is generated
  when it is absent.

**The results-row contract.** A tool that fetches evaluation results (``xp.status``) stores them
on the run with ``update_run {results: {"rows": [...]}}``. Each row is an object with:

- ``episode_id`` (string, unique within the Experiment),
- ``game_version`` (string),
- ``policy_version`` (string): the Version the run played, written as its record id
  (``methods.baseline`` for a baseline arm, ``methods.candidate`` for a candidate arm, e.g.
  ``"V-3"``); rows naming any other policy never pair,
- ``seed`` (integer), ``seats`` (list of integers), ``opponents`` (list of strings),
- ``metrics`` (object of metric name to number; every metric named in ``methods.metrics``),
- ``status`` (``"completed"`` by default, or ``"failed"``) and ``reason`` (string, optional).

Rows with ``status: failed``, a repeated ``episode_id``, another game version or a missing
metric are dropped and counted in the result's ``evaluation.rows.dropped``. Several rows for one
``(policy_version, game_version, seed, opponents)`` - per-seat rows from a mixin's ``evaluate``
output, or several episodes on one seed - are averaged into one row whose seats are their
union, so each seed makes exactly one baseline/candidate pair. The ``evaluation`` design's
seats, opponents and game version are read from the first row; its seeds are the runs' seeds
and the rows' seeds together.

numpy is imported only inside the bootstrap that ``evaluate`` calls, so importing this module
stays light.

"""Bring open chats onto a release's tools and instructions.

Hermes stores what a session first sent and resends those bytes on every later turn, so the
provider's prompt cache stays valid: the tool definitions in ``sessions.tool_names`` and the
system prompt in ``sessions.system_prompt_hash``. It replaces stored tool definitions only when
``tool_pin_version()`` changes, and that identifies Hermes's own build, so a release of this
distribution never reaches an open chat by itself. A chat could keep a ``task`` schema that the
deployed validators refuse.

Preparation therefore compares a hash of what this distribution freezes into a session with the
hash recorded in the profile's ``state.db``. When they differ it asks every session to rebuild
both, once. A release that changes neither keeps every session's cache. Preparation runs before
the gateway on every boot, so a workspace that slept through several releases catches up on its
first turn, and no agent built from the old release is still in memory. That order matters: a
turn on a gateway still running the old release would store the old tools as the new pin, and
with the hash already recorded nothing would clear them.

What this depends on in Hermes (checked by ``core/tests/hermes/test_frozen_sessions_real.py``):

- ``agent.conversation_loop._restore_pinned_tools`` treats ``tool_names = NULL`` as "no usable
  pin": the turn sends the current tools and stores them as the new pin. A tool whose toolset the
  config no longer allows, and a new tool, need nothing from here: the restore already drops or
  adds them, so only the definitions of tools that stay are frozen.
- ``hermes sessions refresh-prompts`` makes each session rebuild its system prompt on its next
  turn and leaves its messages alone. It is a supported command, so only the ``tool_names`` column
  is touched directly.
- The prompt's skill index reads only a ``SKILL.md``'s path and frontmatter
  (``agent.prompt_builder``), so an edit to a skill's body costs no chat a cache miss.
- ``state_meta(key, value)`` keeps keys Hermes does not know. Losing the row costs one more
  refresh, nothing else. The record lives there, not in a file, so that restoring ``state.db``
  from a backup also restores which release its sessions were refreshed for.

A failed refresh must not stop a workspace from starting. No conversation is touched and the next
boot tries again, because the hash is recorded only in the transaction that clears the pins. The
pins stay as they were, though a prompt rebuild may already be requested: the Hermes command
commits on its own, before that transaction.

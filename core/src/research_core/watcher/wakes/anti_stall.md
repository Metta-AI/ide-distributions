# Anti-stall wake

Daily check at the configured hour (event `{event_kind}`, subject `{subject}`, Coworld
`{coworld_id}`). Nothing is known to be wrong; decide whether anything should be moving and is
not. This is a background Session: never write into a user conversation; `ui.notify` is the
only channel to the user.

Payload:

```json
{payload_json}
```

1. Read your briefing and `workspace.doctor`: the active Goals and where each stands, open and
   in-progress Tasks, waits and how long they have lasted, broken capabilities and their
   maintenance Tasks, the champion and the recent Versions, unanswered `ui.ask` questions.
2. For a Goal with no open Task and nothing waiting on the user, create or approve a Task with
   `task.create` or `task.approve`. For a Task waiting longer than its wait should take,
   `task.read` why and answer it (`task.answer`), message it (`task.message`) or abandon it. For
   a repair that keeps failing, say so.
3. If nothing needs to move, end the run without a notice. Otherwise `ui.notify` one short
   summary of what you started or what needs the user, with record references.

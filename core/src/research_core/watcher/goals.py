"""Step 8: Goal conditions and the daily anti-stall event (design §8 wake table, Appendix H).

Three conditions, each an event a management or anti-stall wake acts on; nothing here writes a
record:

* ``goal.needs_ideation`` for an active Goal with no open Task and no Task waiting on the user
  (``goals.needs_ideation``). Emitted once while the condition holds: the Coworld store's meta
  ``ideation_pending:<G-n>`` remembers it and is cleared when the Goal has an open Task again
  (or stops needing ideation for any other reason), so the next time it empties a new event
  follows. A Goal due for parking is not also asked to ideate.
* ``goal.park`` when ``ideation_rounds_without_progress`` reaches the Coworld setting
  ``ideation.park_after_rounds``, once per stretch (meta ``park_pending:<G-n>``); the wake parks
  the Goal with a reason and tells the user.
* ``anti_stall`` once a day at the workspace setting ``anti_stall.hour`` (``HH:MM`` in
  America/Los_Angeles), in the workspace store; meta ``anti_stall_last`` holds the local date it
  last fired (or the day the workspace first ticked), so a tick after the hour fires it even
  when the workspace slept through 04:00, and a brand-new workspace waits until the next day.

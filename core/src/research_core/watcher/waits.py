"""Step 4: resolve what in-progress Tasks wait on, without a model (design B.13).

A Researcher that must wait records ``waiting_on`` with ``task.wait`` and ends its run (A4.4).
Every tick this step checks each wait against its source and, when it is over, calls
``tasks.resolve_wait``, whose ``task.wait_resolved`` event the wake step hands to
``resume.handle_wait_resolved`` after step 5 refreshed run statuses (A5.3). Nothing here
starts or steers a run.

Kinds and what resolves them:

- ``xp``: every request id in ``ref`` is terminal on the platform; progress is also written to
  the Experiment runs that carry those ids when the store lets the watcher (a Task-scoped
  Experiment is written by its holder only, so that write is skipped and the Researcher
  records the results itself);
- ``credits``: the balance is above zero and at least the need the detail states (``need N``);
- ``permit``: a GET of the recorded ask route shows an answer (a 404 is "not yet");
- ``submission``: a submission of the policy version in ``ref`` reached ``placed`` or
  ``rejected``;
- ``platform``: the recorded route answers again (a GET route is probed itself; for any other
  method ``whoami`` stands in, since the probe must not repeat a write);
- ``process``: the pid in ``ref`` is gone;
- ``question``: an undelivered answer exists for the Task;
- ``user``: the setting named in ``ref`` has been set, or the Task named in ``ref`` is approved;
- ``dependency``: every Task this one depends on is complete and did not fail.

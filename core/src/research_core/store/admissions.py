"""Durable client receipts and queued chat inputs, owned by the workspace.

A message admission is ``queued`` until ``research serve``'s dispatcher starts its run, then
``running``, and ends ``completed``, ``cancelled``, ``failed`` or ``interrupted``. A run that
failed for a budget, rate-limit or provider reason leaves it ``waiting`` instead: it resumes on
its own (``research_core.run_failures``). ``error_class`` names the reason for a ``waiting``
or ``failed`` admission when it is known, and ``resume_after`` is the earliest time a
``waiting`` one resumes. The table stores a waiting admission as ``queued`` with
``resume_after`` set (no run, ``dispatch_started`` 0); :func:`snapshot` reports it as
``waiting``, and ``resumes`` counts its resumes.

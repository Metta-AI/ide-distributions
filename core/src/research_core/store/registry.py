"""The field registry: one source for validation, the SOUL Records section and tool schemas.

Each ``RecordSpec`` names a record kind's table, display prefix, fields, statuses and the
status transitions the record modules enforce. Stored fields are named after their columns;
computed fields are what tools derive on read (design B.2 "stored vs computed") and are never
columns. Descriptions are one sentence each, from the design (B.3-B.9, B.13, B.14) and the
draft tables it keeps.

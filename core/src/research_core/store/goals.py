"""Goals: what the user wants, with an end state, a status and computed progress (design B.3).

Stored fields are the columns of ``goals``. ``read`` adds what tools derive: Tasks and
Experiments by status, the claims tagged with the Goal (tag ``G-<n>``) with their freshness,
the Goal's active directives, ``last_progress`` and ``ideation_rounds_without_progress``.

Progress is a Task under the Goal completing with outcome ``succeeded`` (ideation Tasks
excepted: proposing work is not progress), a claim tagged with the Goal being created, or a
Version created by one of the Goal's Tasks or Experiments. An ideation round is an ideation
Task that reached ``complete``; the rounds without progress are those created after the last
progress, which is what the parking rule (``ideation.park_after_rounds``) counts.

Goal-less maintenance Tasks (amendment A2.2) have no Goal row; ``read(store, None)`` returns
the pseudo-Goal "workspace maintenance" that groups them for the briefing and the panel.

The tasks, experiments, claims and versions tables are queried directly: those record modules
are siblings, not dependencies.

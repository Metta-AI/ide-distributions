"""Notices (design A.8 ``ui.notify``): the store side, in the workspace store only (A2.4).

A notice is workspace-level news for the user: the only channel a wake has, rendered by every
client, and unread notices open the next chat turn's context. ``add`` writes the row and an
``events`` row of kind ``notice`` in one transaction, so attached clients see it at once and the
away summary finds it in the log. ``unread`` serves the chat turn: the newest ``limit`` unread
notices in chronological order (a limit drops the oldest). ``mark_read`` records who read them
and when, once; it is bookkeeping and emits no event.

"""Tasks: statuses, approval, leases with epochs, waits, messages, dependencies, checklists.

Design B.4 (the record and its rules), B.12 (completion, review, merge), B.13 (dispatch,
waits, recovery, messages), Figure 3 (the life of a Task); amendments A2.2 (goal-less
maintenance Tasks), A2.3 (epochs on the session row, ``require_holder``), A2.7 (outcomes),
A2.8 (approval and the user's word), A2.10 (``reject``).

Leases. ``claim`` takes the lease inside one ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` transaction and re-reads the
Task there, so of two concurrent claims exactly one wins. A lease is fresh for
``LEASE_FRESH_SECONDS`` after ``lease_renewed``; a stale lease may be claimed by another
Session, which raises ``lease_epoch`` and records the new epoch on that Session's
``task_sessions`` row. Every Task-scoped write by a Researcher goes through ``require_holder``:
the caller must be the holding Session and its session row's epoch must equal the Task's, so a
replaced run cannot write (its late commits are never merged either: the merge uses
``completed_commit``, which only the current holder can record).

Events. Each record write emits one event named here: ``task.created``, ``task.proposed``,
``task.approved``, ``task.updated``, ``task.claimed``, ``task.released``, ``task.waiting``,
``task.wait_resolved``, ``task.asked``, ``task.answered``, ``task.message``,
``task.completed``, ``task.failed``, ``task.reopened``, ``task.reviewed``, ``task.abandoned``,
``task.merged`` and ``task.proposed_submission``. A review that reopens emits both
``task.reviewed`` and ``task.reopened``. Bookkeeping writes (``renew_lease``, ``set_run``,
``set_last_error``, ``mark_delivered``) emit none: they would only flood the stream.

Ids: every ``task_id``, ``goal_id``, ``experiment_id`` and ``version_id`` argument accepts the
integer or the display form (``T-3``, ``G-1``, ``X-2``, ``V-7``).

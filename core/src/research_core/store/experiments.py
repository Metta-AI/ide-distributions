"""Experiments: a comparison of Versions whose design locks at start and ends in a verdict (B.8).

Lifecycle: ``proposed`` (the design may still change) -> ``running`` (``start`` hashes the
hypothesis and methods into ``design_sha256``; from then on neither changes) -> ``confirmed``,
``refuted`` or ``inconclusive`` (``close`` records the measurements read against the decision
rule), or ``abandoned`` with a reason at any point before a verdict. Experiments are never
deleted: a design that has to change is abandoned and the replacement lists it in
``related_experiments``. ``closed`` is when the Experiment ended, by verdict or abandonment.

``create`` and ``update`` check the shape of whatever design is given (types, enumerations,
references that must exist, ``if_true`` differing from ``if_false``, at least one primary
metric), so a proposed Experiment may still be incomplete; ``start`` requires the complete
design and names every missing part. Runs live in ``experiment_runs`` and are written as soon
as the platform accepts them (B.13). ``results`` holds the measurements, the interpretation,
the verdict and the decision rule's reason codes.

Task-scoped writes (``add_run``, ``update_run``, ``close``) need the Task's lease holder when
the Experiment has a Task (A2.3); the check runs inside the write's transaction.

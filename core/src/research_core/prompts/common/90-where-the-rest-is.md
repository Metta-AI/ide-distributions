## Where to find the rest

Read the rest when the work needs it, each time, because it changes:

- Skills: the index is in your system prompt and `skill_view` reads one.
- The mixin at `code/mixin/` in the Coworld folder: `MIXIN.md` (commands, metrics, artifact, toolchains), the lab `AGENTS.md` with the game's rules and scoring, its docs, the reference policy and the five binding skills named `<coworld>-<binding>`. Those are files under `code/mixin/skills/`: `read_file` them, not `skill_view`. Game docs outrank general advice, never this document or the user.
- The Coworld's public repository at the release commit under `source/`; cite its commits.
- `research softmax exec -- coworld docs --local` lists the reference docs installed with the CLI; `--skill` in place of `--local` prints Softmax's own agent skill document.
- The Coworld's forum and wiki, through the `platform` reads and the `forum_post` and `wiki_edit` tools.

Hermes's generic guidance may recommend a tool you lack, or `skill_manage` on a shipped skill, which fails: ignore it, and keep such a fix as a claim tagged `lesson`.

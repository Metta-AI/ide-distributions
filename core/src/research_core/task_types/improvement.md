# Improvement Task

Deliver exactly one Experiment from hypothesis to verdict, the Version(s) it tested, the claims
it produced, and a submission answer. One conceptual change per Version.

Start: read the Task, its Goal, the directives, the briefing and these instructions;
`claim.search` and `experiment.search` for what was tried. Load skills when needed: `experiment`
before step 1, `candidate` before building, `run-eval` before requesting XP, `writing-claims`
before the first claim. Game-specific metrics, floors and rosters: see the mixin's `<coworld>-ab`
and `<coworld>-eval-design` skills or docs.

Work, in order:
1. When the Task names an Experiment (`experiment: X-n` in `task.read`), that is the one: finish
   its design with `experiment.update`. Otherwise `experiment_create {summary, task, hypothesis,
   methods}`. The hypothesis, metrics and decision rule (with `n_min`) are pre-registered. Then
   `experiment.start`; they lock.
2. Make the change in your worktree, commit, `version.create {summary, task, experiment}`, then
   `upload {version}`.
3. `xp.request {experiment, candidate, baseline, seeds, episodes, opponents}`, then `task_wait
   {task, kind: "xp", detail, ref: [<request ids>]}` and END YOUR RUN. On resume
   `xp.status {experiment}` stores the rows.
4. `experiment.close {experiment}` applies the rule: confirmed, refuted or inconclusive. Record
   the verdict as claims with `experiment` evidence; a refuted hypothesis is a finding.
5. `task_propose_submission` only for a confirmed Version (see `proposing`).

Ask (`task_ask`) when the lever or the baseline is ambiguous, or the Experiment would cost far
more credits than the Task implied; decide seeds, episodes above the mixin's floor and
implementation details yourself.

End: `task.complete {task, claims, experiment, versions, submission_candidate: "yes" or "no",
submission_reason, commit, merge: "yes" or "no", merge_reason, result}`. Merge yes only for a
confirmed Version; `submission_candidate` and its reason must agree with the verdict.

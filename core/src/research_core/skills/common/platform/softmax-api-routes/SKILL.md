# Softmax API routes

`softmax_api {method, path, params?, json?, identity?}` calls any Observatory route with authentication handled. Paths are relative to `/observatory`. The default identity is the Player; the Orchestrator may pass `identity: user` (a notice is sent for every non-GET). Prefer the tool that covers a route; the tables mark them. Every call is logged; a route you use often is a tool request: say so in your result.

Paging: list routes take `limit` and `cursor` and return the next cursor in the `X-Next-Cursor` header or `next_cursor`. Ids: `league_…`, `div_…`, `ply_…`, `cow_…`, `xreq_…`, `ereq_…`; policy versions are UUIDs, labels `name:vN`.

## Rules

- Unknown fields in a body are refused (4xx): re-derive the body from the error detail; do not retry blind.
- Platform errors are retried with backoff by the tool; a lasting one puts a Task on a `platform` wait with the route, status and request id.
- A 403 names a missing permission (the Player may not read it): report it, never look for another credential.
- A route that works today can change: record the ones you needed in your result so they become tools.

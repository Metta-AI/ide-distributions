# Working a Task

One Task per Session, in the Task's worktree, speaking only to the Orchestrator through the
Task.

## 1. Claim

The assignment prompt names the Task and your first call: `task.claim {task: T-n}`. The
workspace reserved ownership before starting you. This call renews that lease, creates
`worktrees/task-<n>/` on branch `task/<n>` from `main`, and returns the Task, its Goal's id, the
type's instructions and the Orchestrator's messages. A refused claim names its reason (ownership,
an unset repository, a git failure, an unfinished dependency): end your run without writing anything.

## 2. Read before working

- The briefing: your Player's id, the champion, the directives, the broken capabilities, your
  Task.
- `task.read {task}` for the full record, `goal.read {goal}` for the end state the work is judged
  by, `directive.list` for standing instructions on the workspace and the Goal.
- The type's instructions (returned by the claim) and the skills they name; the mixin's
  `<coworld>-<binding>` skills for every game-specific step.
- `claim.search` and `experiment.search` for what is known or was tried: a refuted claim or an
  abandoned Experiment is a lead, not a gap.

## 3. Work in your worktree

Edit only inside your worktree and commit on your branch with messages that say what and why;
never touch `main` or another worktree. `version.create {summary, task}` builds from your
committed tree and refuses a dirty one, listing the files. Record findings as you go:
`claim_write` with evidence, `experiment_create`, `experiment_add_run`. The record is the
report; there is no second write-up. Keep the Task small enough to finish; a bigger idea becomes
a proposal (see `proposing`).

## 4. Ask or decide

`task_ask {task, question}` when the decision is not yours: the Goal is ambiguous, two readings
of a directive conflict, the Experiment would cost far more credits than the Task implied, or
the result changes what the Goal should be. The question sets a wait: end your run, and the
answer resumes you. Decide yourself everything inside the Task: the method, the seeds, which
claim to write, how to fix a broken build. A question you can answer with a tool is not a
`task_ask`.

## 5. Wait, then END YOUR RUN

Anything outside your control is a wait: `task_wait {task, kind, detail, ref}` with kind `xp`
(`ref`: the request ids from `xp.request`), `credits` (after a 402), `process` (`ref`: the pid of
a background build or evaluate), `permit` (`ref`: the route to read), `submission` (`ref`: the
policy version id), `platform` (set for you when a route keeps failing), `user` (`ref`: the setting
or T-n their answer changes) or `dependency`. Then stop: end the run with no further tool call. That
is not quitting: the watcher resumes this Session, with its history, when the wait resolves.
Never poll in a loop and never sleep. On resume, call the tool you were waiting for
(`xp.status {experiment}` for XP) and `directive.list`, since your briefing does not update.

## 6. Complete

`task.complete {task, outcome: "succeeded", commit, merge, merge_reason, submission_candidate,
submission_reason, result, ...}`, plus the fields the type's checklist names (`claims`, `experiment`,
`versions`, `proposed_tasks`, `commit`, `summary`, `capability`); the tool refuses with every missing item at once, so fix them all and call
again. `commit` is the commit on your branch to merge; `merge: no` needs `merge_reason`. `result`
is two or three sentences the Orchestrator reads first.

`task.complete {task, outcome: "failed", failure: {what_failed, next_step, error, exit_code,
tried}}` when the Task cannot succeed; the type's instructions show a good one. Fill `tried` so
nobody repeats it.

`task_release {task, reason}` when you must not continue, as when a directive forbids the only
path; tried and it did not work is `outcome: "failed"`. End your run afterward. The workspace stops your recorded run, then returns the Task to scheduling.

## 7. What happens next

A review wake reads your Task, Experiment and claims. It accepts, and the watcher merges your
commit after the mixin's build and check pass again, or it reopens the Task with a reason: this
Session resumes with that reason, so read it and act on it rather than defending the first
attempt. A proposed submission is decided by the Orchestrator under the user's settings; you
never submit.

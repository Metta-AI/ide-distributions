"""The one rule set behind the advisory hook (design C.4), shared by both profiles.

A rule recognises a shell command, a code snippet or a file path that bypasses a profile tool
and names the tool to use instead. The hook never blocks: the command runs and the note is
appended to its result. Stdlib only: this runs inside Hermes on every tool result.

"""The Orchestrator's session-context prompt section (design §10, A.3, A.7).

It shows what the client declared when the conversation opened (its session context and the
capabilities of the attached clients) and the fixed authority paragraph for modes and commands.
A snapshot like the briefing (see ``briefing.py`` for when Hermes renders it again); at most
3,800 characters, because two plugin sections share Hermes's 8,000-character budget (amendment
A3.3). Stdlib only.

"""The ``api_request_error`` hook: record failed model calls in the inference state.

Hermes calls the hook after it classifies each failed model call, with the class as ``reason``
(a ``FailoverReason`` value from ``agent/error_classifier.py``: ``billing``, ``rate_limit``,
``overloaded``, ``server_error``, ``timeout``, ...), plus ``session_id``, ``task_id`` and
``status_code``. ``session_id`` is the agent's live id, which compression rotates; ``task_id``
is the session id the run started with, so it is what ties an error to a run.
The hook always records the call as ``last_error``, then:

* a 402 that can still afford output is recorded as ``output_limit`` without closing the gate;
* on ``billing`` (402 credits, or a 403 "Key limit exceeded") it blocks model work as
  ``budget_exhausted`` for the installed key (the lease file's ``key_id``), showing the next
  refill as ``until``. The block ends when the lease loop installs a different key; nobody
  writes to clear it. Within :data:`KEY_CHANGE_GRACE` of the lease's ``key_changed_at`` it
  does not block: such errors come from runs still finishing on the previous, spent key.
* after :data:`OUTAGE_COUNT` outage-class errors within :data:`OUTAGE_WINDOW` it blocks model
  work as ``provider_unavailable`` for :data:`OUTAGE_BLOCK`. Nobody clears that block; it lapses.

The state file lives beside ``IDE_INFERENCE_LEASE_FILE``; without that variable (a profile
run outside a platform-managed workspace) the hook does nothing. It runs inside Hermes: stdlib
only, and it never raises.

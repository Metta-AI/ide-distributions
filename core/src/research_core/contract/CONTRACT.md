# The client contract (version 1)

The profiles own one small contract with clients: the IDE, the site, coplay, and any scripted
client. It is published here as three JSON Schema files plus this note. The design calls it
**the seam** (design §10); what is still to build is listed at the end and extends these files
without breaking them.

| File | What it describes |
|---|---|
| `context.schema.json` | The typed context block a client sends with each message (A.3, A.4). |
| `events.schema.json` | One row of a store's `events` table as the stream delivers it (A.11). |
| `ui-state.schema.json` | The UI state document the `ui` tool writes per conversation (A.10). |

A client reads the current files from the installed profile with `research context-schema
[--name context|events|ui-state]`; it never hard-codes them.

## The three channels

1. **Context in.** A client sends `session-open` once (its identity, a session context and its
   capabilities), then `{message, context}` for each turn. The bridge validates the context,
   stamps it and keeps it beside the message; the profile's turn hook renders it for the model.
2. **UI output and state sync.** The `ui` tool and the watcher write UI state and notices into
   the store; every write is an `events` row. The bridge streams the rows to all attached
   clients as Server-Sent Events, so each client renders what it can and all stay in sync.
3. **UI actions and edits back.** Answers to the agent's questions are queued to the Session
   like a message; reactions are feedback for the next turn; user edits go through `store apply`.

Locally `research serve` is the bridge (design A.11, R3). Its routes are the reference for the
hosted bridge:

| Route | Channel | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /session-open` `{op_id, client: {id, kind, guide?}, session_context?, capabilities?, actor?}` | 1 | Registers a chat Session; returns `{session_id, client, coworld, session_scope, contract_version, problems}`. `op_id` is a UUID the client generates and reuses when it retries the same call. |
| `POST /message` `{op_id, session_id, message: {role: "user", content}, context?, instructions?, actor?}` | 1 | Validates and stamps the block and accepts the message durably; returns `{op_id, session_id, run_id, delivered: "queued", problems, seq}` before any run takes it (see "Runs per Session"). `op_id` as above. |
| `POST /ui-action` `{session_id, action, payload, actor?}` | 3 | `answer {ask_id, value}` patches the ask and queues the answer; `reaction {message_id, value}` writes UI state and starts no run. |
| `POST /store/apply` `{actor, op, args, store?, coworld?}` | 3 | One op of the `store apply` allow-list as `user:<id>`; returns `{record, seq}`, or HTTP 202 with `{status: "pending", command, ...}` when the op is a transition still running (read it at `GET /command`). A `directive_id` is `W-<n>` (workspace) or `D-<n>` (Goal); a bare number or a contradicting `store` is refused. |
| `GET /snapshot?store=workspace\|coworld&coworld=<id>` | 2 | The store's records, settings, UI state documents and `seq`. `coworld` is required for a Coworld's store. |
| `GET /stream?store=…&coworld=<id>&after=<seq>` | 2 | SSE of the store's events after `seq`. |
| `GET /runs/<run_id>` | 1 | The run's status from the Hermes runs API. |
| `GET /models` | 2 | Each profile's model: `{profiles: [{profile, role, model, provider, fallbacks}]}`. See "Profile models". |
| `GET /models/catalog` | 2 | The models a client may offer: `{source, models: [{id, name, context_length, usd_per_million_input, usd_per_million_output, free}]}`. |
| `POST /models` `{profile, model, provider?, fallbacks?, actor?}` | 3 | Changes one profile's model as the user asked; returns `{profile, previous, changed, verified, seq}`. |
| `GET /health` | — | `{ok, profile, coworld, contract_version}`. |
| `GET /` and `GET /ui` | — | A convenience of `research serve`, not a contract channel: the client page (`research_core/ui/index.html`), which exercises every channel above. |
| `GET /status` | — | A convenience of `research serve`: what `research watcher status` prints (`heartbeat`, `has_work`, `waiting_on`, `paused`, `sleep_started`). |

Errors are JSON `{ok: false, error, problems}` with an HTTP status: 400 for a malformed or
refused request, 404 for an unknown session, ask or store, 409 for an ask already answered or a
block whose scope, Coworld or league differs from the Session's, 503 with `Retry-After: 1` when the gateway cannot take the run now (retry), 502 for any other
gateway failure. The `actor` of a write is `user:<id>` (default `user:local`); a session actor
is refused, because Sessions write through the tools.

## The seam fields and the four stamps

Every field of the context block is optional except `contract_version`. The fields and their
limits are in `context.schema.json`. The block travels in
the durable admission separately from the user message; the profile's turn hook reads that
admission, validates the block again and renders it for the model.

The bridge stamps four items into each turn (design A.4). `research serve` stamps the first
two into the block; the profile's own turn hook (`plugin/turn.py`) adds the last two, so the
bridge never writes them:

| Stamp | Who | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `client` — the client that opened the Session (`id`, `kind`, `guide`) | bridge | the block; it overrides any `client` the message carried |
| `coworld` — the Session's Coworld | bridge | the block; a block naming another Coworld is refused (409) |
| the changes since this conversation's last turn | turn hook | `[changed since your last turn]` |
| the unread notices | turn hook | `[notices since your last turn]` |

`contract_version` is stamped too, so a block always carries it.

## Limits and validation (A.7)

The whole block is at most 16 KB as JSON and `client_data` at most 8 KB; `mode.name` and
`command.name` at most 40 characters, their `instruction` at most 1,000; `on_screen` at most 20
items. Unknown fields are dropped and named in `problems`; an oversize or malformed field is
refused with a message naming the limit, never truncated; the rest of the block is kept. A bad
field never fails a turn: `/message` answers 200 with `problems`, for the client, and the message
goes on without the refused parts. Only a mismatch with the Session is refused (409 above).

## The client guide skill

`client.guide` names the skill the agent loads for that client (for example `client-coplay`).
It replaces free instruction text, which the bridge drops. Without `ui.ask` in the client's
capabilities the agent asks in chat.

## The stream (A.11)

A client loads `/snapshot` for a store, then opens `/stream?store=…&after=<the snapshot's seq>`;
nothing falls between the two. Each store (the workspace store and each Coworld store) has its
own `seq`, so a client keeps one cursor per store and one connection per store. Frames are
`id: <seq>` and `data: <event JSON>` (the event per `events.schema.json`, plus `store`); a
`: keepalive` comment goes out after ten idle seconds; new rows appear within half a second.
A reconnecting client sends `Last-Event-ID` (or `after`) with the last `seq` it saw. Clients
ignore event kinds and content kinds they do not know.

## Runs per Session

The Hermes gateway does not serialise runs per session, so the bridge does (amendment A6.1). It
accepts a message or a UI answer durably and answers `delivered: "queued"`, usually with `run_id`
null; the client does not retry and follows the admission below. Later, text for a Session with a
live run is steered into that run; otherwise the message waits its turn and starts a new run with
the same session id, which resumes the conversation's history. A reaction never starts a
run: it is a UI state change under `/reactions/<message id>` of the conversation, which the
agent sees at its next turn.

## Message admissions

Each queued message is an admission in the workspace snapshot (`records.admissions`): `{op_id,
session_id, message, status, run_id, error, error_class, resume_after, created_at, client_id}`.
`status` is `queued` until its run starts, then `running`, and ends `completed`, `cancelled`,
`failed` or `interrupted`. A run that fails for a reason that passes on its own leaves the
admission `waiting`: not finished, and not to be retried by the client. The bridge resumes it by
itself once `resume_after` has passed and model work may start again, with a fixed continuation
prompt in the same Session (beginning `Your previous run stopped because`), not the user's text
again; if the resumed run fails the same way, the admission waits again, each time for longer
(the hold doubles per resume, up to 30 minutes). The resumed run keeps the admission's
`instructions` and context. Its continuation prompt is a new user message in the native
transcript; `/messages/context` joins the admission's context to the user's original message,
so the continuation shows `client_context: null`. A `waiting` admission holds its Session: later
messages stay `queued` behind it until it resumes, and a text message among them then joins the
resumed run, as any follow-up joins a live run. A message that had joined the run that failed
ends `failed` with the class rather than waiting: the one resume continues the whole
conversation, that message included. `POST /message-cancel` cancels a `waiting` admission at
once; a cancelled message never waits.

`run_id` is the admission's current run: `null` while it is `waiting`, and a new run on each
resume. A client follows the admission's `status` until it is `completed`,
`cancelled`, `failed` or `interrupted`, and tracks whichever run `run_id` names at the time, not
the first run it saw.

`GET /status`'s `has_work` counts `queued` and `running` admissions, but neither `waiting` ones
nor the messages queued behind one in the same Session, on purpose: a budget wait lasts until the daily refill, and must not keep the workspace awake that
long. The workspace may sleep; a waiting admission resumes once the workspace is awake again
(for example, when the user's next message wakes it).

`error_class` names why a `waiting` or `failed` admission's run failed, when that is known
(`null` otherwise); `error` keeps Hermes's own text. A resuming admission is `queued` again and
keeps the class of the run that failed until its new run starts, when the class is cleared:

| `error_class` | Status | What the client can say |
|---|---|---|
| `budget_exhausted` | `waiting` | Out of budget until `resume_after` (the refill time) |
| `rate_limited` | `waiting` | Busy, retrying |
| `provider_unavailable` | `waiting` | Model provider down, retrying |
| `too_large` | `failed` | Conversation too long; start a new one |
| `misconfigured` | `failed` | Workspace misconfigured |

A message whose cancel was requested never waits: with any of the first three classes it ends
`failed`, keeping the class.

`resume_after` is the earliest time a `waiting` admission resumes (ISO time; `null` for any
other status). A budget wait can last past it, until the workspace's new key arrives.

## Profile models

Each profile's model belongs to the profile, not to the host: a new install starts with what the
profile's shipped `config.yaml` names (the Orchestrator: `moonshotai/kimi-k3.1-pro`, falling
back to `z-ai/glm-5.3`; a Researcher: `recursive/flint-v1.0:free`, falling back to
`moonshotai/kimi-k3`, all through OpenRouter), and only the user changes it, through the bridge.
`prepare.py` does not change it, with one exception: an Orchestrator on `moonshotai/kimi-k3`
through OpenRouter, with no `profile.model_updated` event yet, moves once to
`moonshotai/kimi-k3.1-pro`, recorded as that event with the actor `harness`. `moonshotai/kimi-k3.1-pro` and `moonshotai/kimi-k3` go only to
Moonshot's own OpenRouter endpoint: `provider_routing.models` pins them, unless the owner routed
that model. Another model the user picks gets no pin.

- `GET /models` lists every profile of the sandbox (the Orchestrator, then each Researcher
  profile) with its `role` (`orchestrator` or `researcher`), `model`, `provider` and
  `fallbacks` (`[{provider, model}]`, tried in order when the primary fails).
- `GET /models/catalog` is the list a model picker offers: OpenRouter's models that take tool
  calls (the profiles need them), with context length and prices in US dollars per million
  tokens. It is cached for ten minutes; 503 with `Retry-After: 30` when it cannot be read.
- `POST /models` `{profile, model, provider?, fallbacks?, actor?}` changes one profile.
  `model` is an id such as `moonshotai/kimi-k3`; `provider` defaults to the profile's current
  one; `fallbacks`, when present, replaces the list (each entry a model id or `{model,
  provider?}`, at most four; an absent `fallbacks` keeps the list). Only a `user:<id>` actor
  may change a model. An OpenRouter model not on the catalog is refused (400, named in
  `problems`); when the catalog cannot be read and no earlier list is held, the change is made
  and `verified` is false.
  `changed` lists the config keys written (empty, and no event, when nothing differed); an
  unknown profile is 404.
- A change is a `profile.model_updated` event in the workspace store (subject: the profile;
  payload: the new `{profile, role, model, provider, fallbacks}` with `previous` and
  `changed`), so every attached client sees it on its stream.
- A change applies to the next run of every conversation of that profile: Hermes reads the
  profile's config when a run starts. A run already going finishes on the model it started
  with. The bridge must not name a `model` in its run requests, or the request would override
  the profile's choice.

## Versioning

`contract_version` is an integer in every schema file and in every block. It increments on any
breaking change: a removed or renamed field, a tightened limit, a changed meaning. Adding an
optional field or a new event kind is not breaking: clients ignore what they do not know, and
the backend drops what it does not know. A client sends the version it was built for; the
backend accepts the current one and refuses others in `problems`.

## Deferred to the contract layer

Not part of the seam, and not built here: `session-update`, the panel kinds' rendering rules,
multi-client replay of UI state, relaying live chat
tokens and client-supplied guides by reference.

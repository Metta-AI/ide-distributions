"""The situations the findability measurement puts to the model.

Each is one realistic paragraph, written by reading what the skills and tools cover, and never
naming the tool or the skill it wants. ``skills`` are the skills whose text covers the situation,
most specific first (empty: none is needed, so opening one is only counted as a cost); ``acts``
are the calls that do the right thing, as ``tool.action``, ``tool`` for a flat tool, or a Hermes
tool's name. Reads that the skill text says come first do not count against a run: see
``usability_probe.py`` for how a run is judged.

An Orchestrator situation is a chat message, or a real wake prompt with an event. A Researcher
situation is a Task from the real ``task_start`` prompt, already claimed unless ``claimed`` is
false, optionally after ``prior`` calls whose results set the scene.

The fixture world (``usability_context.BRIEFING``): Coworld ``cow_cogs``, League
``league_cogs_main``, Versions V-7 (champion), V-11 (uploaded) and V-12 (built), Goals G-1 and
G-2, claims C-2 and C-5.

The ``-hard-`` situations (:data:`HARD`) are the discriminating tier. The plain ones say plainly
what is wanted, so a reader of the tool list gets them right; these turn on something only the
skill or tool text settles: which of two similar records to use, which arguments follow the rule,
or that the right move is to say something and stop (``"text"`` in ``acts``).

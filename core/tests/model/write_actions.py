"""The write-action cases and how one is run and judged (``test_write_actions.py`` runs them).

Each case offers the role's whole tool list as a Hermes session does (``harness.full_toolset``,
``tool_choice: "auto"``) with a one-line instruction, and judges the model's first call to the
expected tool: a call to that tool with no ``action``, or with any action that is not a read. A
call to an action's own tool counts as the grouped tool and action (``ShippedSchemas.canonical``).
That call must pass the checks production runs before anything changes: ``validate_args`` (the
tools' argument check) and, for the actions whose store checks need no records, those checks
too (``RECORD_CHECKS``). Calls before it get the answer production would give: the tool's own
refusal when the argument check refuses them, otherwise a plausible result (``RESULT``, or the
case's ``read_result``). A model that has not called the tool within ``MAX_REQUESTS`` requests
(``MAX_REQUESTS_REAL_CONTEXT`` with a captured context) fails the case. A recovery case starts
from a history holding one or three refused calls: the first answered with the refusal the tool
returns today, a repeat with the shorter one the repeat hook puts in its place, and is sent as the
plugin's request middleware sends it, with only the latest of identical refused calls. Measured on
2026-11-04 with a real context and no such middleware, the rate was 60/60 after one refusal and
22/60 after three, so both depths are measured.

Which write actions are covered. One case per write action, of the record tools (claim, goal,
task, experiment, directive, settings, ui), that has at least two required fields, so the model
has to compose arguments rather than pass one reference; plus ``ui.notify``, the incident wake's
other write. Left out, to keep a run small:
  - actions with the same shape as a covered one: task.propose and task.reject for the
    Orchestrator (task.create, task.answer), task.link (two references), and the
    Researcher's claim.retire and experiment.abandon (covered for the Orchestrator);
  - workspace.change_complete, which needs a worktree the instruction cannot make plausible;
  - the tools without actions (submit, upload, wiki_edit, softmax_api): their schemas mark required
    fields as required at the top level, so a provider can enforce them, which the action tools
    cannot;
  - the other tools (version, xp, platform, forum_post, github): ``test_tool_call_format.py``
    sends each one instruction;
  - actions whose only required field is one reference (task.approve, experiment.start, ...).

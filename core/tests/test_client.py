"""The :class:`ScriptedClient` (plan Task 6.3): its own behaviour over a running seam server.

The routes themselves are covered in ``test_serve.py`` (which drives them through the same
client); these tests cover what the client adds: run waiting, the bounded stream read, the
notices view, errors as :class:`SeamError`, and the session bookkeeping.

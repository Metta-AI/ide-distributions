# Self-contained workspace image (integration draft)

This image builds on distribution PR #116's `research workspace sleep` and
`research workspace wake`. It includes PR #117's source-acquisition and routed-profile fixes.
The image owns profile installation, dependency resolution, internal paths, gateway setup,
watcher activation and the translation from generic lifecycle requests to research commands.

Build from the repository root:

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f image/Dockerfile -t ide-distribution:local .
```

The host supplies a durable `/workspace`, writable `/tmp`, and a read-only
`/run/workspace/bootstrap.json` containing `workspace_id`, `platform_url`, and
`credential`. Run the image entrypoint as its declared numeric user, with a read-only
root filesystem and no Linux capabilities. No source checkout or dependency installation
is needed outside the image.

The lifecycle adapter sends replies over the platform's authenticated outbound workspace
connection. Explicit sleep starts the distribution command asynchronously; status reports
ready for sleep only after its successful exit. The image also initiates sleep after fifteen
minutes without work. Restart calls wake with the retained filesystem.

This is not a deployable application release yet. Application relay operations return 501;
the `/ide-final` adapter and platform-issued model credential acquisition remain unfinished.
Do not publish this image as the default workspace or interpret lifecycle proof as chat proof.
The local proof uses real Kubernetes storage and relay transport, but fixture authentication;
it does not establish production authentication, gVisor or EBS behavior.

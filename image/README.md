# Self-contained workspace image

This image builds on distribution PR #116's `research workspace sleep` and
`research workspace wake`. It includes PR #117's source-acquisition and routed-profile fixes.
The image owns profile installation, dependency resolution, internal paths, gateway setup,
watcher activation and the translation from generic lifecycle requests to research commands.

Build from the repository root:

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f image/Dockerfile -t ide-distribution:local .
```

The host supplies a durable `/workspace`, writable `/tmp`, and a read-only
`/run/workspace/bootstrap.json` containing `workspace_id`, `platform_url`, and
`credential`. Run the image entrypoint as its declared numeric user, with a read-only
root filesystem and no Linux capabilities. No source checkout or dependency installation
is needed outside the image.

The lifecycle adapter sends replies over the platform's authenticated outbound workspace
connection. Explicit sleep starts the distribution command asynchronously; status reports
ready for sleep only after its successful exit. The image also initiates sleep after fifteen
minutes without work. Restart calls wake with the retained filesystem.

The release dispatcher passes the distribution commit to Metta's generic build workflow.
That workflow builds `image/Dockerfile`, runs `image/system_tests/start-stop.sh`, and publishes
an immutable image digest. Hosting consumes that digest without inspecting profile internals.
Deploy Metta #30090's format readers and release workflow before dispatching this release.

This image provides the build, hosting and lifecycle foundation for ide-next. Application
relay operations return 501 until the ide-next application adapter is connected; lifecycle
acceptance does not establish chat or model-service behavior.

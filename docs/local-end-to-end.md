# Running the research profiles end to end on a Mac

How to run the rebuilt `orchestrator` and `researcher` profiles on your own machine in a setup
that is as close to Softmax hosting as a laptop gets: a real Hermes gateway multiplexing both
profiles with one API key, one shared `IDE_WORKSPACE`, a per-profile `.env`, the seam the
bridge speaks, and `research serve` as the coordinator (it owns watcher ticks and starts every
run; no cron job does). `docs/hosting.md` says what production provides; this
page says how to stand the same thing up locally and what still differs.

Options A and B run through one harness, `core/tests/hermes/test_seam_real_hermes.py`, which
is also the acceptance scenario ("submit the starter as my champion" ends in a submission). Its
timings below are from October 28, 2026 (Pacific), on Hermes v0.21.6 and `moonshotai/kimi-k3`
through OpenRouter; those options have not been rerun on the pinned Hermes v0.22.6. Option C runs
the same profiles inside the hosted image through `tools/local_stack.py`; it passed on November 4
on the pinned image.

| Option | What you get | When |
|---|---|---|
| A. One command | The acceptance scenario on a real gateway with the fake platform; exits when done | A quick check that the whole chain works |
| B. Interactive session | The same setup kept running: seam URL, `curl` lines, Ctrl-C to stop; optionally the real platform | Poking at the profiles by hand |
| C. Inside the hosted image | `tools/local_stack.py`: the same stack inside the Hermes image CI uses, the checkout mounted read-only, the state on a volume, the coordinator as a lifetime service; stays up until `down` | The closest to production on a laptop |

## Prerequisites

- `uv` and `git`. Run everything from the repository root after `uv sync` (the workspace
  environment plus pytest and ruff, Python 3.12).
- A local Hermes, for Options A and B. The image pins v0.22.6, commit `f0d94882`
  (`install-stamp.json` in the image). Build it in an isolated environment of a Hermes checkout at
  that commit rather than installing it globally, with Python 3.14 as the image does:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent.git ~/coding/tools/hermes-agent-pinned
  cd ~/coding/tools/hermes-agent-pinned && git checkout f0d94882
  UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=~/coding/tools/hermes-env-pinned uv sync --python 3.14 --frozen --no-dev --extra messaging
  export HERMES_BIN=~/coding/tools/hermes-env-pinned/bin/hermes
  ```

  `--extra messaging` matters: it brings `aiohttp`, without which the gateway starts but its
  API server does not, and nothing in the harness can reach it. The harness runs `prepare.py`
  with the `python` next to `HERMES_BIN`, which is Hermes's own interpreter, as hosting does.
  The tests skip when `HERMES_BIN` is unset or does not name a file.
- An OpenRouter key in `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. Every turn calls the model (the default is
  `moonshotai/kimi-k3.1-pro` for the Orchestrator and `recursive/flint-v1.0:free` for a Researcher,
  from each profile's `config.yaml`; `GET /models` on `research serve` shows and changes them). The metta token broker vends
  one under the scope `openrouter`:

  ```bash
  cd ~/coding/metta && python3 scripts/token_broker_client.py exec --scope openrouter \
    --reason "local end-to-end run of the IDE research profiles" -- \
    env HERMES_BIN=$HERMES_BIN uv run --project ~/coding/ide-distributions \
      pytest -q -m hermes core/tests/hermes/test_seam_real_hermes.py -s
  ```

  The key reaches only the child command; it is never printed or written outside the run's
  temporary `.env` files.
- For the real platform (Option B with `IDE_E2E_PLATFORM=real`) a **test** Player's
  `SOFTMAX_PLAYER_ID` and `SOFTMAX_PLAYER_CREDENTIAL` (a bare `cga_` token, or a player session
  as JSON; see `researcher/distribution.yaml`), `COGAMES_API_URL` when it is not
  `https://softmax.com/api`, and `IDE_E2E_COWORLD`, the Coworld the Session opens on. The scenario
  makes a real submission as that Player and spends model calls doing it. Check the credential
  first:

  ```bash
  SOFTMAX_PLAYER_CREDENTIAL=... COGAMES_API_URL=... uv run research softmax whoami
  ```

## What every option sets up

The harness builds, in a fresh temporary directory, what hosting builds in a sandbox:

| In the harness | In hosting (`docs/hosting.md`) |
|---|---|
| `host/`, the gateway's `HERMES_HOME`, with `.env` and `profiles/orchestrator`, `profiles/researcher` installed with `hermes profile install <checkout>/<role> --name <role> --yes` | One sandbox, one profile home per role, installed from the release checkout |
| One `API_SERVER_KEY` (32 hex characters) in the host's and both profiles' `.env`, with `API_SERVER_ENABLED`, `API_SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1` and a free `API_SERVER_PORT` | The same key in every profile (Hermes authenticates `/p/<profile>/v1/runs` with that profile's key) |
| `IDE_WORKSPACE=<root>/workspace` in every `.env`, plus `IDE_PLATFORM`, `SOFTMAX_PLAYER_ID`, `IDE_RESEARCHER_PROFILES=researcher` and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | The per-profile `.env` hosting writes |
| `prepare.py --source <checkout>/<role> --hermes $HERMES_BIN` for each role, which records the core path, creates the stores, applies the protected config keys, removes the former watcher cron job and builds the workspace environment (`uv sync`) under `workspace/tools/venv` | The same script, run after every install and update; the environment is prebuilt at image build |
| `hermes gateway run` with `GATEWAY_MULTIPLEX_PROFILES=true`, ready when `GET /v1/capabilities` answers 200; its output in `gateway.log` | The multiplexing gateway |
| `SeamServer` (`research serve`'s class) in the pytest process, bound to a free loopback port | Metta's bridge |
| `research serve` owns watcher ticks every 60 seconds; the scenario only polls for completion | The same coordinator, without an observation cron |

The gateway enables its API server from the host home's `.env`, not from the process
environment, and under multiplexing each profile's `.env` reaches the plugin through Hermes's
secret scope (`research_core.plugin.executor.profile_env`), which is exactly what the
"submission was made as the profile's Player" assertion checks.

## Option A: the one-command run

```bash
cd ~/coding/ide-distributions
HERMES_BIN=$HERMES_BIN OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... \
  uv run pytest -q -m hermes core/tests/hermes/test_seam_real_hermes.py -s
```

`-s` shows the harness's output as it happens; without it you see nothing until the end. The
first run builds the workspace environment with `uv sync`, which takes a few minutes; later runs
reuse uv's cache but still build into the new temporary workspace. Install and preparation of
both profiles took 67 seconds and the gateway was ready 3 seconds after start on October 28
(`docs/spikes/s1-dispatch.md`).

What it prints:

```
gateway log: <root>/gateway.log
profiles: <root>/host/profiles
workspace: <root>/workspace
chat run run_<hex> (queued)
poll 1: waiting for coordinator-owned work
7 polls, 38 s
session Coworld: cow_fake
notices: [...]
submissions by Player: {'ply_canary': 1}
```

`<root>` is pytest's temporary directory for the run (something like
`/private/var/folders/.../pytest-of-<you>/pytest-<n>/acceptance0`); pytest keeps the last three,
so the paths stay readable after the run. `--basetemp=<dir>` puts the run where you choose
(pytest removes that directory first if it exists). The `poll` lines show every sixth five-second
check for a submission. A second test in the module, `test_transcripts_are_where_the_output_says`, then checks
that the gateway log and the Orchestrator's `state.db` exist.

How to read a failure:

- `gateway exited <code>; see <root>/gateway.log` or `gateway not ready within 180 s`: open the
  log. The usual cause is a Hermes environment without `--extra messaging` (the gateway runs,
  the API server does not).
- `prepare <role>:` followed by the script's output: preparation failed, most often `uv sync`
  (network, or a lock that does not match).
- `no submission after <n> s; gateway log <path>, notices [...]`: the chat run or the setup wake
  did not get to a submission within `SCENARIO_TIMEOUT_S` (600 seconds). Read the gateway log
  around the run id printed as `chat run run_...`, the notices, both stores' events
  (`research store events --after 0`, below) and the fake platform's state file
  `<root>/workspace/.state/fake_platform.json` (`counts`, `policies`, `submissions`).
- `the submission was not made as the profile's Player ply_canary: {'ply_fake': 1}`: the
  tools ran without the profile's `.env` (the fake's default Player is `ply_fake`); that is the
  secret-scope path in `executor.profile_env`.
- `assert session["coworld_id"] == selected_coworld`: the Session is no longer on the Coworld it
  opened on.

## Option B: an interactive session that stays up

Four environment variables turn the harness into a session you can talk to. All are off by
default, so CI runs the acceptance scenario exactly as before.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `IDE_E2E_KEEP=1` | After the scenario (pass or fail) the gateway and the seam server stay up. The harness prints the URLs, where the API key is, ready-to-paste `curl` lines and the `research` commands for this run, opens a chat Session if the scenario did not, prints the coordinator's health every 60 seconds, and stops the seam server and the gateway on Ctrl-C. |
| `IDE_E2E_SCENARIO=0` | Sends no request: an empty prepared workspace to talk to. Only useful with `IDE_E2E_KEEP=1` (alone, the module skips). |
| `IDE_E2E_PLATFORM=real` | The real Softmax platform instead of the fake; see below. |
| `IDE_E2E_TIMEOUT_S=<seconds>` | Replaces the 600-second scenario timeout (a real build takes longer than the fake). |

Keep the session after the scenario:

```bash
IDE_E2E_KEEP=1 HERMES_BIN=$HERMES_BIN OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... \
  uv run pytest -q -m hermes core/tests/hermes/test_seam_real_hermes.py -s
```

An empty workspace, no request sent:

```bash
IDE_E2E_KEEP=1 IDE_E2E_SCENARIO=0 HERMES_BIN=$HERMES_BIN OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... \
  uv run pytest -q -m hermes core/tests/hermes/test_seam_real_hermes.py -s
```

The banner the harness prints (paths and ports are those of the run; the key itself is never
printed, the shell reads it from the profile's `.env`):

```
=== interactive session (IDE_E2E_KEEP=1); Ctrl-C stops the gateway ===
seam (research serve routes):  http://127.0.0.1:<port>
gateway (Hermes API server):   http://127.0.0.1:<port>  routes under /p/<profile>/
API key:                       <root>/host/profiles/orchestrator/.env  (API_SERVER_KEY, same in every profile)
gateway log:                   <root>/gateway.log
profile homes:                 <root>/host/profiles
workspace (IDE_WORKSPACE):     <root>/workspace
workspace environment:         <root>/workspace/tools/venv
chat session:                  api_<epoch>_<hex>

research CLI from the workspace environment ...:
  export HERMES_HOME=<root>/host/profiles/orchestrator IDE_WORKSPACE=<root>/workspace IDE_PLATFORM=fake SOFTMAX_PLAYER_ID=ply_canary IDE_RESEARCHER_PROFILES=researcher
  <root>/workspace/tools/venv/bin/research watcher status
  ...

curl against the seam:
  curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:<seam>/session-open -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"op_id": "<new UUID>", "client": {"id": "curl", "kind": "web-ide"}, "actor": "user:local"}'
  curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:<seam>/message -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"op_id": "<new UUID>", "session_id": "api_...", "message": "What is the state of the workspace?", "actor": "user:local", "context": {"contract_version": 1, "on_screen": []}}'
  curl -s http://127.0.0.1:<seam>/runs/<run_id>
  curl -s 'http://127.0.0.1:<seam>/snapshot?store=workspace'
  curl -sN 'http://127.0.0.1:<seam>/stream?store=workspace&after=0'

curl against the gateway (a fresh session id, so it never races the chat Session):
  KEY=$(grep '^API_SERVER_KEY=' <root>/host/profiles/orchestrator/.env | cut -d= -f2-)
  curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:<gateway>/p/orchestrator/v1/runs -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"input": "Reply with READY and stop.", "session_id": "api_..."}'
  curl -s http://127.0.0.1:<gateway>/p/orchestrator/v1/runs/<run_id> -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"

Coordinator health is observed every 60 s below.
[10:54:37 PDT] coordinator health: {...}
```

The seam's routes are those of `research serve` (`core/src/research_core/serve.py`): `POST
/session-open`, `/message`, `/ui-action`, `/store/apply`; `GET /snapshot`, `/stream`,
`/runs/<id>`, `/health`. `/session-open` and `/message` require a caller-generated UUID `op_id`; preserve it when retrying
the same input. `/message` confirms a durable receipt with
`{op_id, session_id, run_id, delivered, problems, seq}` and `delivered: queued`.
Read `records.admissions` in the workspace snapshot for the assigned run and its status.
Messages wait behind an existing run in the same session. `/stream` is Server-Sent Events with `id: <seq>` and the event JSON
in `data:`; `?store=coworld` streams the active Coworld's store. `core/src/research_core/client.py`
(`ScriptedClient`) is the same conversation in Python.

Ctrl-C ends the loop, the seam server shuts down, the module's fixture terminates the gateway,
and the second test runs. If the scenario had failed, pytest reports that failure after the
session ends; the run directory stays for reading.

### The real platform

```bash
IDE_E2E_KEEP=1 IDE_E2E_PLATFORM=real IDE_E2E_TIMEOUT_S=1800 \
  SOFTMAX_PLAYER_ID=ply_... SOFTMAX_PLAYER_CREDENTIAL=... COGAMES_API_URL=https://softmax.com/api \
  IDE_E2E_COWORLD=cow_... \
  HERMES_BIN=$HERMES_BIN OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... \
  uv run pytest -q -m hermes core/tests/hermes/test_seam_real_hermes.py -s
```

With `IDE_E2E_PLATFORM=real` the harness does not configure the fake platform and writes
`IDE_PLATFORM=real` plus `SOFTMAX_PLAYER_ID`, `SOFTMAX_PLAYER_CREDENTIAL`, `IDE_E2E_COWORLD` and
`COGAMES_API_URL` (when set) from your environment into the host's and both profiles' `.env`. The
three required ones must be set, or the test fails naming them. The Session opens on
`IDE_E2E_COWORLD`, so the fixed request applies to it.

The scenario's assertions were kept, read through the real client: it records the Player's
submissions on the ladder when it starts and passes when a submission that was not there
before appears (`RealPlatform.submissions(player_id=...)`), and the Session must still be on
`IDE_E2E_COWORLD`. The per-Player check is implied by the ladder's Player
filter (the real `Submission` record carries no Player id), so a run with the real platform
proves the chain ends in a submission as the test Player, not that the fake's `.env` isolation
holds; the fake run checks that. The harness never prints the credential; it is in the run's
`.env` files, so delete the run directory (or use `--basetemp` somewhere private) when done.
`SOFTMAX_USER_CREDENTIAL` is not written: User-identity reads report themselves unavailable,
as in a sandbox before provisioning.

## A client page

`research serve` also serves a browser client at `GET /` (and `/ui`):
`core/src/research_core/ui/index.html`, one self-contained page (inline CSS and JavaScript, no
build step, nothing fetched from outside the seam) in the Ink & Print house style. It is a
developer's view of the seam, not the IDE: every part of it maps to one route, so it is the
quickest way to watch a Session, the watcher and the stores at once.

Open it against any of the options, or without a model at all:

| Against | URL |
|---|---|
| Option B (`IDE_E2E_KEEP=1`) | The seam URL the banner prints, `http://127.0.0.1:<seam>/` |
| Option C | The seam URL that option prints, reachable the way its "Attaching a client" section says |
| A `research serve` of your own (`IDE_WORKSPACE` and `HERMES_HOME` exported, from the workspace environment) | `http://127.0.0.1:8650/` (or the `--port` given) |
| No gateway and no model: `uv run python tools/ui_dev.py [--port 8650]` | The URL it prints; a temporary workspace on the fake platform, the watcher ticking every 5 seconds on a thread, and `research_core.scripted_agent.ScriptedAgent` playing the Orchestrator (removed on Ctrl-C) |

What each part of the page exercises:

| Part | Routes | What to look for |
|---|---|---|
| Masthead and health strip | `POST /session-open` on load (client `ui`, kind `web-ide`), `GET /health`, `GET /status` every 5 seconds | The session id; profile, active Coworld and contract version; the watcher's heartbeat age, `has_work` with its `waiting_on` reasons, `paused`; whether each stream is open |
| Conversation | `POST /message` with a context block (`mode`, `on_screen`, `view` from the fields under the box), `GET /runs/<id>` every half second until the run is terminal, `POST /ui-action` `reaction` | `delivered` (`queued`) and the run id on your message; the run's status chip, then its output as the Orchestrator's message; "Helpful" / "Not helpful" write a reaction and show the UI-state version it landed in (no run starts) |
| Now showing, Asks, Panels | The `ui_state` documents of `GET /snapshot?store=workspace`, then `ui.patch` events; `POST /ui-action` `answer` | The last `ui.show`; open asks with their options as buttons (a free-text answer too), answered asks with the answer and who gave it; markdown panels as text, other kinds as JSON |
| Notices and Events | `GET /stream?store=workspace&after=0` and `GET /stream?store=coworld&after=0` (Server-Sent Events; the browser reconnects with `Last-Event-ID`) | `notice` events as a list, newest first; every event as one line (seq, time, store, kind, subject) with a payload summary, the last 300 kept |
| Records | `GET /snapshot?store=coworld` (Goals, Tasks, Versions, Claims, Experiments) and `?store=workspace` (both stores for Directives and settings), refreshed when a record event arrives | Tabs with counts, each record's id, title, status and last update, a Details button with the record as JSON; any `G-1`, `T-3`, `V-1`, `C-2`, `X-1`, `D-1` or `N-1` on the page jumps to its record |
| Edits as user:local | `POST /store/apply` | Add a Directive, rename a Goal, set a Goal's status, change a setting, pause or resume the watcher; the store's record or its refusal with the problems. Creating a Goal is not a user edit (`goals.create` is not in the allow-list): ask the Orchestrator for one |
| Raw request | Any route | Method, path and JSON body; the status and the response. `session_id` is filled in for `/message` and `/ui-action` when the body leaves it empty |

Against `tools/ui_dev.py`'s scripted Orchestrator (a real one answers as the model sees fit):

- **Submit the starter as my champion.** switches to the fake Coworld; within a few ticks the
  setup wake uploads and submits the starter, and a notice about `V-1` arrives.
- A message containing **ask me** opens a question with two options; answer it under Asks and
  the answer goes into a run of the same Session.
- A message containing **notify** sends a notice.
- A message containing **goal** creates a Goal (once a Coworld is active), brings it into view
  under Now showing and sets a markdown panel about it.
- Anything else is answered with `Noted: <the first 80 characters>`.

The routes are tested in `core/tests/test_serve.py`; the page itself was checked by hand in a
browser at 390, 1000 and 1280 pixels wide, in light and dark mode.

## Option C: inside the hosted Hermes image

CI runs the `hermes`-marked tests inside `nousresearch/hermes-agent@sha256:d27689bc...` (the
digest in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and the base of `image/Dockerfile`), whose Python runs the plugin and `prepare.py` exactly as
hosting does. `tools/local_stack.py` runs the whole stack in that image on your Mac: the checkout
mounted read-only at `/src` like the release checkout, the profile homes, the workspace and the
logs on a Docker volume, the multiplexing gateway with the coordinator as a lifetime service, and
`research serve` as the seam, both published on this machine's loopback.

**Verified on November 4, 2026 (Pacific)** with OrbStack (Docker server 29.8.2, linux/arm64; the
image runs natively on Apple silicon) and the Hermes the image ships (v0.22.6). `up` on a fresh
volume had the gateway and the seam answering in 12 seconds, and the acceptance scenario through
the seam ended in a submission by `ply_canary` 65 seconds after the request (seq 13 of the Coworld
store). The exact output is below.

### Prerequisites

- OrbStack (or another Docker) running: `open -a OrbStack`. The first `up` pulls the image when
  it is missing (4.5 GB).
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the environment of the first `up` on a volume. The broker shape from
  the prerequisites above works unchanged:

  ```bash
  cd ~/coding/metta && python3 scripts/token_broker_client.py exec --scope openrouter \
    --reason "local stack of the IDE research profiles in the Hermes image" -- \
    uv run --project ~/coding/ide-distributions python ~/coding/ide-distributions/tools/local_stack.py up
  ```

  The key goes into the container only, into the `.env` files on the volume (that is how Hermes
  reads it); the tool never prints it and writes nothing on this machine. A later `up` without
  the key in the environment keeps the one already in the `.env` files.
- For the real platform, the same variables as Option B: `SOFTMAX_PLAYER_ID`,
  `SOFTMAX_PLAYER_CREDENTIAL`, optionally `COGAMES_API_URL` and `IDE_DEFAULT_COWORLD`.

### Commands

```bash
cd ~/coding/ide-distributions
uv run python tools/local_stack.py up                 # real platform as your Player (see below)
uv run python tools/local_stack.py up --platform fake # no credentials, no network; runs the scenario once
uv run python tools/local_stack.py status             # container, seam /health, gateway /v1/capabilities, watcher status
uv run python tools/local_stack.py scenario           # fake: send "Submit the starter as my champion." and wait (real: add --really, with IDE_DEFAULT_COWORLD set)
uv run python tools/local_stack.py logs [--follow]    # tail /opt/data/gateway.log and /opt/data/serve.log
uv run python tools/local_stack.py shell              # a shell in the container with the Orchestrator's environment
uv run python tools/local_stack.py down               # stop the services and the container; the volume stays
uv run python tools/local_stack.py down --reset       # also remove the container and the volume
```

`up` on an existing container stops the seam and the gateway, runs `hermes profile update` and
`prepare.py` for both profiles, as a boot of the image does, and starts them again; `up --reset`
starts over. `--platform`, `--seam-port` (default 8650) and `--gateway-port` (default 8642, all given
after `up`) and `--name` (default `ide-local`, given before the command; the volume is
`<name>-stack`) are fixed when the container is created and read back from its labels afterwards.
The scenario is written for a new workspace: run it once per volume, or `up --reset` first.

### What `up` sets up

One container from the image digest as its Hermes user (`--user 10000:10000`,
the entrypoint replaced by `sleep` under `--init`), with `~/coding/ide-distributions` at
`/src` read-only, the volume at `/opt/data`, both ports published on `127.0.0.1` only and the
`GIT_*` identity CI sets. It writes two scripts into the volume and runs the first with `docker
exec`:

| Step inside the container (`/opt/data/local_stack/bootstrap.sh up`) | In hosting |
|---|---|
| Install `uv` into `/opt/data/.local/bin` (the image ships none, CI uses `astral-sh/setup-uv`), which is on the Hermes user's login-shell `PATH`; mark `/src` safe for git (it belongs to your Mac user) | The image has `uv` |
| Stop any running seam and gateway. `hermes profile install /src/<role> --name <role> --yes` into `HERMES_HOME=/opt/data/host` for both roles, or `hermes profile update` when the profile exists | The same, from the release checkout |
| Write `/opt/data/host/.env` and both profiles' `.env`: one random `API_SERVER_KEY` per volume (kept in `/opt/data/local_stack/api_key`), `API_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0` in the host home (the gateway binds from there, so the published port reaches it) and `127.0.0.1` in the profiles (where the watcher and the seam read the gateway's address), `GATEWAY_MULTIPLEX_PROFILES=true`, `IDE_WORKSPACE=/opt/data/workspace`, `IDE_PLATFORM`, `IDE_RESEARCHER_PROFILES=researcher`, `SOFTMAX_PLAYER_ID` (`ply_canary` for the fake), `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, and for the real platform the Player credential, `COGAMES_API_URL` and `IDE_DEFAULT_COWORLD` | The per-profile `.env` hosting writes |
| `prepare.py --source /src/<role> --hermes /opt/hermes/.venv/bin/hermes` with the image's Python, each with `HERMES_HOME=<profile home>` and that profile's `.env` exported (`as-profile.sh`); the first run builds the workspace environment with `uv sync` into `/opt/data/workspace/tools/venv` (uv's cache and the CPython 3.12 it fetches stay on the volume) | The same script; the environment is prebuilt at image build |
| Fake platform: build the fakegame fixture repository at `/opt/data/upstream/fakegame_repo` and point the fake's manifest at it (`tools/local_stack/configure_fake_platform.py`, as the real-Hermes test does) | n/a |
| `hermes gateway run` with the host home, in the background, log `/opt/data/gateway.log`; ready when `GET /v1/capabilities` answers 200 with the key. The lifetime `research serve` coordinator owns observation and workflow advancement | The multiplexing gateway |
| `research serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8650` from the workspace environment with the Orchestrator's environment, log `/opt/data/serve.log`; ready when `GET /health` answers | Metta's bridge |

Timings on November 4, 2026 (Apple silicon), fresh volume: both profile installs 3 s, the two
preparations 4 s including the `uv sync`, fixture under a second, gateway ready 4 s after start,
seam 1 s: 12 s in all. A re-`up` took 10 to 39 seconds.

### Where things live in the volume (`ide-local-stack`, mounted at `/opt/data`)

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `host/` | The gateway's `HERMES_HOME`: `.env` and `profiles/orchestrator`, `profiles/researcher` |
| `host/profiles/<role>/.env`, `config.yaml`, `local/core-path.txt` (`/src/core/src`), `state.db`, the Orchestrator's `cron/jobs.json` | What install, `prepare.py` and the gateway wrote; `cron/jobs.json` holds no jobs |
| `workspace/` | `IDE_WORKSPACE`: `tools/venv`, `.state/store.db`, `.state/fake_platform.json`, one folder per Coworld |
| `upstream/fakegame_repo` | The fake Coworld's source repository (fake platform only) |
| `local_stack/` | `bootstrap.sh`, `as-profile.sh`, `api_key`, the services' pid files |

`docker exec ide-local cat /opt/data/local_stack/api_key` prints the key. `shell` drops you
into the container with `HERMES_HOME=/opt/data/host/profiles/orchestrator`, the profile's
`.env` exported and the workspace environment first on `PATH`, so the commands under "What to
look at" work as written with `RESEARCH=research`.

### The output

`up --platform fake` on a fresh volume on November 4, with `--name ide-audit` and other ports (the
`hermes profile install` banners and Hermes's config lines are left out; `prepare.py`'s JSON
summary lines and the event are shortened; `scenario` is run by hand here):

```

`status` on that stack, before the scenario:

```
container ide-audit: running
platform: fake; volume: ide-audit-stack
seam http://127.0.0.1:18650/health: 200 {"ok": true, "profile": "orchestrator", "coworld": null, "contract_version": 1}
gateway http://127.0.0.1:18642/v1/capabilities: 200
watcher: {"ok": true, "heartbeat": "2026-11-05T03:00:01.456138Z", "heartbeat_age_s": 0.1, "has_work": false, "waiting_on": [], "paused": false, "paused_drained": false, ...}
```

`scenario` opens a Session on `cow_fake` (or on `IDE_DEFAULT_COWORLD` on the real platform), sends
the request, then reads that Coworld's event stream through the seam until a `version.submitted`
event arrives, with a progress line every 30 seconds.

How to read a failure: `the gateway exited; see /opt/data/gateway.log` or `not ready within 180
s` come with the log's last 40 lines (a gateway that refuses to start prints why there);
`prepare.py` failures print the script's output (most often `uv sync`: network, or a lock that
does not match); `no version.submitted after <n> s` means the chat run or the wakes did not get
to a submission in time: `logs`, then from `shell` the commands under "What to look at"
(`research store events --after 0`, the fake platform's state file).

### Attaching a client

The seam is `research serve` on `http://127.0.0.1:8650` with the routes of Option B (`POST
/session-open`, `/message`, `/ui-action`, `/store/apply`; `GET /snapshot`, `/stream`,
`/runs/<id>`, `/health`), so the `curl` lines above, `ScriptedClient("http://127.0.0.1:8650")`
from `core/src/research_core/client.py`, and any client of the seam contract talk to it from
the Mac. The gateway is `http://127.0.0.1:8642` with the routes under `/p/<profile>/` and the
key from the volume:

```bash
KEY=$(docker exec ide-local cat /opt/data/local_stack/api_key)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8642/v1/capabilities -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8642/p/orchestrator/v1/runs -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"input": "Reply with READY and stop.", "session_id": "api_local_1"}'
```

Both ports are bound to `127.0.0.1` on the Mac; inside the container the two servers listen on
`0.0.0.0` of a network namespace in which nothing else runs.

### The real platform

The default. The stack talks to `https://softmax.com/api` (or `COGAMES_API_URL`) as one of
your Players:

```bash
softmax player list                        # your Players; `softmax player use <id>` picks one
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... uv run python tools/local_stack.py up --reset            # the active Player
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... uv run python tools/local_stack.py up --reset --player ply_...
```

Without `SOFTMAX_PLAYER_ID` and `SOFTMAX_PLAYER_CREDENTIAL` in the environment, `up` takes the
Player from this machine's `softmax` login: the active Player's session (a 24-hour token
`softmax player use` minted, kept in the CLI's `credentials.yaml`), or the `--player` id. It
prints which Player and when the session expires; an expired session is refused with the
command that mints a new one. The token goes into the `.env` files on the volume, as hosting
would write it, and stays there until `down --reset` or until it expires, after which `up`
again reads a fresh one. Set the two variables yourself to use a Player this machine is not
logged in as.

On the real platform `up` never runs the submission scenario on its own, and `scenario` refuses
without `--really`, because the scenario uploads and submits the starter policy to a real
league as your Player. Ask the Orchestrator for what you want through the seam instead; it
finds Coworlds with `platform.leagues` and `platform.coworld`, and a switch clones the
Coworld's source repository from the manifest (or from a `source` URL you name). A Session opened
with `session_context.coworld` registers that Coworld (`POST /session-open`).

### What still differs from production

- **gVisor.** Docker's default runtime (OrbStack's), not gVisor; the S3 check (a second process
  reading a WAL store under gVisor) is not exercised.
- **Sleep and drain.** Nothing puts the container to sleep: the image's lifecycle adapter
  (`image/control.py`) does not run here. From `shell`, `research workspace sleep` and `research
  workspace wake` run the sleep cycle by hand (the container keeps running; `docs/hosting.md`,
  "Coordinator and pause"). `/opt/hermes/.venv/bin/python $HERMES_HOME/scripts/activity.py` prints
  `{"waiting_on": [...]}` from the watcher's last tick (an empty list means no running work).
- **The bridge.** `research serve` plays metta's bridge; the clients are `curl` and
  `ScriptedClient`, not the IDE.
- **Player provisioning.** Hosting selects the Player at workspace creation and mints and
  refreshes `SOFTMAX_PLAYER_CREDENTIAL` (a player session lasts 24 hours); here you paste a test
  Player's credential and nothing refreshes it. `SOFTMAX_USER_CREDENTIAL` is absent, so
  User-identity reads report themselves unavailable.
- **Entrypoint.** Production runs the image's s6 init, which drops to the unprivileged `hermes`
  user before the gateway. The launcher replaces init with `sleep` and starts services itself,
  but installation, preparation, the gateway and tools all run as that same user (UID 10000).
  Use a fresh named stack for this version; it does not change ownership on older root-owned
  volumes.
- **The workspace environment** is built by `prepare.py` on the first `up`, not prebuilt at image
  build (`IDE_WORKSPACE_ENV`).
- **Hermes's warnings.** The gateway logs that its API server is network-accessible with the
  unsandboxed `local` terminal backend, and that it ingested `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from the
  environment; both are expected here.

What is as in production here and was not in Options A and B: the image and the Hermes it ships,
the read-only checkout, and the lifetime coordinator (`research watcher status` shows its heartbeat).

## What to look at

With the variables the banner printed exported (`HERMES_HOME` is the Orchestrator profile home,
`IDE_WORKSPACE` the workspace; in a real-platform run `SOFTMAX_PLAYER_CREDENTIAL` is already in
your shell), from the workspace environment:

```bash
RESEARCH=$IDE_WORKSPACE/tools/venv/bin/research
$RESEARCH watcher status                                # {"heartbeat", "heartbeat_age_s", "has_work", "waiting_on", "paused", "paused_drained", "sleep_started"}
$RESEARCH tool workspace --args '{"action": "doctor"}'  # commits, watcher heartbeat, both stores' schema, capabilities, CLIs, core_path.writable, api_keys, problems
$RESEARCH store snapshot --store workspace              # coworlds, sessions, notices, directives, settings, ui_state, and seq
$RESEARCH store snapshot                                # the active Coworld's store: goals, tasks, claims, versions, champion, ...
$RESEARCH store events --after 0 --store workspace      # the workspace store's events as JSON lines; --follow tails
$RESEARCH store events --after 0                        # the active Coworld's events
$RESEARCH workspace sleep --wait 30                     # pause, stop every run, flush every database and the volume; exit 0 = safe to stop
$RESEARCH workspace wake                                # clear sleep's pause; the next tick resumes the drained Sessions
$RESEARCH workspace drain                               # the raw drain step alone: stop Researcher runs, mark their Sessions to resume
```

`research store snapshot` without `--store` refuses until a Coworld is active ("no active
Coworld; pass --store workspace, or switch to a Coworld first").

On disk:

- `<root>/gateway.log`: everything the gateway wrote, the chat run, the wake runs and the
  plugin's tool calls included.
- `<root>/host/profiles/orchestrator/state.db` (and the Researcher's): Hermes's own session
  store; `sqlite3 <path> .tables` to look around. `GET /p/<profile>/api/sessions/<id>/messages`
  on the gateway is the same history over HTTP.
- `<root>/host/profiles/<role>/.env`, `config.yaml` and `local/core-path.txt`: what `prepare.py`
  wrote.
- `<root>/workspace/.state/store.db` and `<root>/workspace/<coworld>/.state/store.db`: the
  stores the `research store` commands read; `<root>/workspace/.state/fake_platform.json`: the
  fake platform's state in a fake run.
